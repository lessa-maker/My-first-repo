Project name; Development of an open online plateforme, making science research easy, 
and accessible for agricultural students in Cameroon.
Hi everyone, I hope you are doing very well like me. I am LESSA TCHOHOU Fabrice from Cameroon. 
I am a young graduate of Seed Industries/Seed Technology. I have a lot of passion for Bioinformatics and data management.

Actually, we are building a platform with experts in the domains of agriculture, bioinformatics and computer science. The platform will help undergraduate agricultural students identify research topics, internship opportunities, and other courses that will build up their carrier. The lack of quality research with accessible funds and good research proposals and topics for graduate and undergraduate students have been the main problem in Cameroon and in Africa as a whole. We believe that this platform will contribute to reducing the gap in agricultural improvement. 

The exciting aspect of the project is to empower students in research methodology skills, proposal writing, and grant writing and management.  
    
Actually, I never thought the aim of this project will not be easily attained. This is because we don't have all the resources like experts in platform development and strategic communication.
